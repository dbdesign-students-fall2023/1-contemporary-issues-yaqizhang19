# Data Privacy Concerns of Period Tracking Apps
Recently, there has been a worldwide discussion on the data privacy of period trackers, especially after the U.S. overturned citizens' constitutional right to abortion. I found two articles in relation to the topic. 

## Article 1
The BBC’s [The abortion privacy dangers in period trackers and apps](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-61952794) by Zoe Kleinman explores how data from period tracker apps could potentially be used to incriminate individuals seeking abortions if law enforcement authorities were to access this data. It also examines the actions tech firms are taking to safeguard user data in this context, which is considered fragile as they do not use end-to-end encryption like WhatsApp and Signal. It is criticized and worried that the data may be used for punitive purposes, particularly the 13 states which have already moved to make ending a pregnancy illegal. 

The revelation in this article about the potential misuse of period data is concerning and should serve as a wake-up call for users of period tracker apps and advocates of data privacy alike. Individuals who rely on these apps for health tracking and family planning should be vigilant in protecting their data. 

Furthermore, the article underlines the importance of strict regulation on access to sensitive databases, even by government entities, in the digital age. Privacy information should indeed be stored locally whenever possible, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential abuse. It’s worth discussing whether legal authorities should be grant access to all databases.

## Article 2
The other article, [Period trackers to be reviewed over data concerns](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66740184), shares a similar theme but rather accessed it from the UK government’s point of view. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office is conducting a review of period tracker apps due to concerns about data security and transparency. The review will investigate issues such as complex privacy policies, unnecessary data collection, and potentially upsetting targeted advertising while urging users to share their experiences.

It is interesting to see that concerns about data privacy and security are easily receiving worldwide attention. The article highlights the proactive stance of the government office in investigating these issues. The privacy rights of citizens should be primary, and government access should be strictly regulated and subject to stringent checks. 

Additionally, I agree with the point about the unnecessary collection of data by these period tracking apps. Period cycle data is intensely personal and is not necessarily something that should be collected by the developer. The fact that most of these apps share user data with third parties is concerning and underscores the need for a reevaluation of data collection practices. When designing data-related apps or databases, one should consider whether to store data locally or on a business server.
